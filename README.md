# API-Challenge
The repo includes two Jupyter notebooks for WeatherPy and VacationPy, 12 plots as instructed with titles indicating the parameters used for calculation, and one csv file that holds the list of cities with their coordinates and weather data extracted from Weather API. 
For Part I, the description of three observable trends based on the data were included in the Jupyter Notebook (as comments).
For Part II, a screenshot of the heatmap created is also included.
